# Monitoring (Legacy or Alternative)

This directory contains a previous or alternative implementation for performance monitoring (`performance_monitor.dart`).

**This module may be related to or superseded by the more recent UI performance monitoring capabilities introduced in `lib/core/observability/monitoring/ui_performance_monitor.dart`.**

Consider the following actions:
-   **Review:** Evaluate if the functionality in `performance_monitor.dart` is still relevant, if it serves a different purpose (e.g., general application performance vs. specific UI jank/load times), or if it has been fully replaced by `UiPerformanceMonitor`.
-   **Integrate:** If `performance_monitor.dart` offers valuable insights or metrics not covered by `UiPerformanceMonitor` (e.g., network performance monitoring aspects, custom business transaction monitoring), plan to integrate these capabilities. This might involve making `UiPerformanceMonitor` more comprehensive or having them coexist if their concerns are distinct.
-   **Phase Out:** If `performance_monitor.dart` is redundant or its functionality is better handled by `UiPerformanceMonitor` and other observability services (like Sentry for performance monitoring), plan for its deprecation and eventual removal.

This helps ensure a clear and unified approach to performance monitoring within the application.
