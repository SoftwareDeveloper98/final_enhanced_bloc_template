# Logging Module (Legacy)

This directory contains a previous or alternative implementation for logging (`logging_module.dart`).

**This module may be superseded by the more recent logging abstraction located in `lib/core/observability/logging/` (which includes `LoggerService`, `ConsoleLogger`, `SentryLogger`, etc.).**

Consider the following actions:
-   **Review:** Evaluate if the functionality in `logging_module.dart` is still relevant or if it has been fully replaced by the services in `lib/core/observability/logging/`.
-   **Integrate:** If there are valuable aspects in `logging_module.dart` not covered by the new services, plan to integrate them into the new structure.
-   **Phase Out:** If `logging_module.dart` is redundant, plan for its deprecation and eventual removal to simplify the codebase and avoid confusion. Ensure all parts of the application are updated to use the new `LoggerService` via dependency injection.

This helps maintain clarity and ensures that the application consistently uses the intended logging framework.
