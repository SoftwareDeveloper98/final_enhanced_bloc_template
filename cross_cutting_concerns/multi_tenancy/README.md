# Multi-Tenancy

The implementation of multi-tenancy is highly dependent on the specific requirements of the application.
This can range from schema-per-tenant, database-per-tenant, or a shared schema with tenant identifiers,
and also impacts how data is isolated, how configurations are managed per tenant, and how authentication
and authorization are handled.

Due to this variability, specific files are not predefined here. Implementation should be carefully
designed based on product and infrastructure needs.
