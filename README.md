## About This Project

This project serves as a comprehensive starting point for building large-scale Flutter applications. It aims to demonstrate solutions for common challenges faced in enterprise development, such as modularity, scalability, team collaboration, and long-term maintainability.

## Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** Organized into layers (domain, data, presentation) and features. Utilizes local packages via Melos.
*   **Environment Configuration (Flavors):** Support for multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) using Flutter flavors and `.env` files (conceptual, actual .env setup varies).
*   **Dependency Injection:** Using GetIt for managing dependencies. (See `lib/core/di/`)
*   **State Management:** (Specify your chosen solution, e.g., BLoC/Cubit, Provider, Riverpod). Placeholder: "BLoC/Cubit is used for state management. See `docs/state_management.md` (TODO)."
*   **Routing:** (Specify your chosen solution, e.g., GoRouter, AutoRoute). Placeholder: "GoRouter is used for navigation. See `docs/routing.md` (TODO)."
*   **Testing Framework:** Comprehensive setup for unit, widget, and integration tests. (See `docs/testing_strategy.md`)
*   **Localization:** Support for multiple languages using Flutter's built-in internationalization tools (ARB files). (See `docs/localization_pipeline.md`)
*   **Secure Storage:** Handling sensitive data like API keys and user tokens. (See `lib/core/security/`)
*   **Observability:** Logging, analytics, crash reporting, and performance monitoring hooks. (See `lib/core/observability/`)
*   **Monorepo Setup (Melos):** Manages multiple local packages for features and shared code. (See `melos.yaml` and `packages/`)
*   **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and builds. (See `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`)
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Guidelines and explanations for various aspects of the project. (See `docs/`)

## Prerequisites

*   Flutter SDK (version specified in `pubspec.yaml`, e.g., 3.19.x or your project's version)
*   Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)
*   Melos (for monorepo management): `dart pub global activate melos` (or use via `dart run melos` as per `NOTE_ROOT_PUBSPEC.md`)
*   An IDE (Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code) with Flutter plugins.
*   (If applicable) Platform-specific tools: Xcode for iOS, Android SDK for Android.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_org/your_repo.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd your_repo
    ```

2.  **Bootstrap the project (using Melos):**
    This command will install dependencies for the root project and all local packages defined in `melos.yaml`.
    ```bash
    melos bootstrap
    # or dart run melos bootstrap
    ```
    (Refer to `NOTE_ROOT_PUBSPEC.md` for ensuring Melos is listed as a dev dependency in the root `pubspec.yaml`.)

3.  **Configure Environment (if applicable):**
    If your project uses `.env` files for environment-specific configurations:
    ```bash
    # Example: cp .env.example .env.dev (if you provide .env.example files)
    echo "API_BASE_URL=https://dev.api.example.com" > .env.dev
    echo "API_BASE_URL=https://staging.api.example.com" > .env.staging
    echo "API_BASE_URL=https://prod.api.example.com" > .env.prod
    ```
    (Note: Actual `.env` file management strategy needs to be defined. Ensure `.env.*` files containing secrets are in `.gitignore`.)

## Running the App

The application uses Flutter flavors to manage different build configurations.

### Flavors (Environments)

*   **Development (`dev`):**
    *   Entry point: `lib/main_dev.dart`
    *   Env file (example): `.env.dev` (if using flutter_dotenv or similar)
*   **Staging (`staging`):**
    *   Entry point: `lib/main_staging.dart`
    *   Env file (example): `.env.staging`
*   **Production (`prod`):**
    *   Entry point: `lib/main_prod.dart`
    *   Env file (example): `.env.prod`

**Example run commands:**

*   **Run Development version:**
    ```bash
    flutter run --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart
    ```

*   **Run Staging version:**
    ```bash
    flutter run --flavor staging -t lib/main_staging.dart
    ```

*   **Run Production version:**
    ```bash
    flutter run --flavor prod -t lib/main_prod.dart
    ```
(For IDEs like VS Code, configure these in `launch.json`. For Android Studio, create corresponding Run/Debug Configurations.)

**Building an App:**
Replace `run` with `build apk`, `build appbundle`, or `build ipa`.
*   Example: Build Production App Bundle:
    ```bash
    flutter build appbundle --flavor prod -t lib/main_prod.dart --release
    ```

## Project Architecture Overview

The application generally follows Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into Data, Domain, and Presentation layers, further organized by features.
For a detailed explanation, diagrams, and principles, please see `docs/architecture/README.md`.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized for modularity and scalability. Key directories include:
*   `lib/app/`: Core application setup (DI, routing, main app widget).
*   `lib/core/`: Shared utilities, services, and abstractions (networking, storage, observability, etc.).
*   `lib/features/`: Individual feature modules (e.g., auth, home, profile).
*   `lib/shared/`: Widgets, constants, and extensions shared across features.
*   `packages/`: Local Dart packages (managed by Melos) for `core_ui`, `feature_auth`, etc.
*   `docs/`: All project documentation.
A more detailed guide is planned: `docs/folder_structure_guide.md` (TODO).

## State Management

This project uses BLoC/Cubit for managing application state.
More details can be found in `docs/state_management_guide.md` (TODO).

## Routing

Navigation is handled by GoRouter (or your chosen package).
See `docs/routing_guide.md` for usage and configuration (TODO).

## Testing

The project emphasizes comprehensive testing: Unit, Widget, and Integration tests.
For detailed strategies and examples, see `docs/testing_strategy.md`.

## Localization

Multi-language support is managed using ARB files and `flutter gen-l10n`.
See `docs/localization_pipeline.md` for the translation management process.

## Asset Management

Assets are in `assets/`. We recommend `flutter_gen_runner` for typed asset access.
Guidelines are in `assets/NOTE.md`.

## Coding Conventions

We follow Effective Dart and rules in `analysis_options.yaml`.
See `docs/coding_style_guide.md` for more.

## Git Branching Strategy

We use GitFlow: `main` for releases, `develop` for integration, feature branches (`feature/`) and bugfix branches (`bugfix/`). Hotfixes (`hotfix/`) are branched from `main`.
More details are in `docs/git_strategy.md` (TODO).

## CI/CD

Automated workflows are in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
See `docs/ci_cd/README.md` for details.

## Adding a New Feature

A guide for scaffolding a new feature is in `docs/new_feature_guide.md` (TODO).

## Documentation

All project documentation is in `/docs`. This includes ADRs, architecture details, and guides.

## Contributing

Please read `CONTRIBUTING.md` (TODO) for guidelines.
