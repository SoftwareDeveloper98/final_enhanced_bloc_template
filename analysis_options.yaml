linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
    # Additional rules (example)
    always_declare_return_types: true
    avoid_print: true # Recommend using a dedicated logger instead
    prefer_final_locals: true
    prefer_relative_imports: true
    # Add more rules as needed for stricter analysis
