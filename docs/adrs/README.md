# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Flutter Enterprise Scaffold App.
ADRs are short documents that capture significant architectural decisions made during the project's lifecycle. Each ADR describes the context of a decision, the decision itself, and the consequences (both positive and negative).

## Purpose of ADRs
-   **Record Rationale:** To document the reasons behind choosing a particular architectural approach, technology, or pattern.
-   **Share Knowledge:** To help team members (current and future) understand the architectural evolution and constraints of the system.
-   **Avoid Re-Debating:** To prevent reopening discussions on topics that have already been decided, unless new significant information comes to light.
-   **Improve Consistency:** To guide future decisions by providing a historical context.

## Format
Each ADR should typically follow a simple template, such as:
-   **Title:** A short, descriptive title (e.g., "001-Use Clean Architecture with BLoC"). The number helps in ordering and referencing.
-   **Status:** (e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded by ADR-XXX)
-   **Date:** The date the ADR was last updated or accepted.
-   **Context:** What is the issue that needs to be decided? What are the drivers for this decision?
-   **Decision:** What is the chosen solution?
-   **Consequences:** What are the positive and negative consequences of this decision? What are the trade-offs? What are the impacts on other parts of the system or on development practices?
-   **Alternatives Considered (Optional):** Briefly mention other options that were considered and why they were not chosen.

## Creating a New ADR
1.  Copy an existing ADR or use a template.
2.  Assign a new sequential number (e.g., `002-your-decision-title.md`).
3.  Fill in the sections.
4.  Discuss the ADR with the team.
5.  Once accepted, update its status and merge it.

## List of ADRs
(This section can be manually updated or a script could generate it)

-   [001-multi-module-with-melos.md](./001-multi-module-with-melos.md) - Decision to use a monorepo structure with Melos for package management.
-   ... (add more as they are created)

Using a lightweight ADR format like "MADR" (Markdown ADRs) is common.
