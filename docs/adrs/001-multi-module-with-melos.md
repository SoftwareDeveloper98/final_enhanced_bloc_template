# ADR 001: Use Monorepo with Melos for Package Management

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2023-10-27 (Replace with actual date)

## Context

As the Flutter Enterprise Scaffold App project grows, managing shared code, feature modules, and overall project complexity becomes increasingly challenging with a single large codebase (monolithic structure within `lib/`). We need a way to:
-   Improve modularity and separation of concerns.
-   Allow different teams or individuals to work on features or shared libraries with more autonomy.
-   Facilitate better code reusability across different parts of the application or even potentially across different projects in the future.
-   Streamline dependency management and scripting for a multi-package setup.

## Decision

We will adopt a **monorepo structure managed by Melos**.
This involves:
1.  Creating a `packages/` directory at the root of the project.
2.  Structuring distinct parts of the application as local Dart/Flutter packages within this directory. Examples include:
    *   Shared UI libraries (e.g., `core_ui`)
    *   Core utility/service libraries (e.g., `core_networking`, `core_logging`)
    *   Feature modules (e.g., `feature_auth`, `feature_home`, `feature_profile`)
3.  The main Flutter application (in the root `lib/` directory) will act as an "app shell," depending on these local packages.
4.  **Melos** will be used to:
    *   Manage dependencies across all packages (including linking local path dependencies).
    *   Run scripts (linting, testing, code generation) consistently across all or selected packages.
    *   Potentially manage versioning and publishing of packages if they were ever to be published (though initially, they are for internal use, `publish_to: 'none'`).

## Consequences

### Positive:
-   **Improved Modularity:** Clear boundaries between different parts of the application.
-   **Enhanced Scalability:** Easier to scale development efforts as teams can own specific packages.
-   **Better Code Reusability:** Shared libraries (`core_ui`, `core_utils`) can be explicitly defined and depended upon.
-   **Independent Development (to a degree):** Teams can work on their packages with some level of independence, though integration is still key.
-   **Simplified Build/Test Scripts:** Melos provides a unified way to run commands across multiple packages.
-   **Clearer Dependency Graph:** Dependencies between local packages are explicitly defined in their `pubspec.yaml` files.
-   **IDE Support:** Melos helps configure IDEs (like VS Code, IntelliJ) to correctly understand the multi-package structure.

### Negative/Challenges:
-   **Increased Initial Setup Complexity:** Setting up Melos and structuring the project into packages requires initial effort.
-   **Learning Curve:** Team members need to understand how Melos works and the conventions of a monorepo.
-   **Dependency Management Overhead:** While Melos helps, managing versions and resolving conflicts across many local packages can still be complex if not handled carefully.
-   **Potential for Over-Granularization:** Care must be taken not to break down the app into too many tiny packages, which could increase complexity unnecessarily.
-   **IDE Performance:** In very large monorepos, IDEs might experience performance degradation, although Melos aims to mitigate this.
-   **CI/CD Configuration:** CI/CD pipelines need to be adapted to understand the monorepo structure and potentially run jobs more selectively based on changed packages.

## Alternatives Considered

1.  **Single Large `lib/` Directory (Monolith):**
    *   **Pros:** Simpler initial setup.
    *   **Cons:** Becomes unwieldy for large projects, poor separation of concerns, harder to scale team collaboration, difficult to reuse code in other projects.

2.  **Separate Git Repositories for Each Package (Multi-repo):**
    *   **Pros:** Full independence of packages.
    *   **Cons:** Significant overhead in managing dependencies between repos (Git submodules, manual versioning, local path overrides that are hard to manage), more complex CI/CD, harder to make atomic changes across multiple packages. This was deemed too complex for the current scale.

Melos with a monorepo offers a good balance between the simplicity of a single repository and the modularity benefits of multiple packages.
