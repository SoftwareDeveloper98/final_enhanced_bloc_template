# Application Architecture

This document provides a detailed explanation of the application architecture adopted for the Flutter Enterprise Scaffold App. Our goal is to create a scalable, maintainable, testable, and understandable codebase suitable for enterprise-level development.

## Core Principles

The architecture is guided by the following core principles:

1.  **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** Different parts of the application have distinct responsibilities and are isolated from each other. This is primarily achieved through layering and feature modularization.
2.  **Dependency Rule (Clean Architecture):** Dependencies flow inwards. Outer layers (like UI and Infrastructure) depend on inner layers (like Domain and Application/Use Cases), but not vice-versa. Abstractions are owned by the inner layers.
3.  **Modularity:** The application is broken down into self-contained feature modules and shared core/utility packages. This promotes parallel development, reduces coupling, and improves code organization. (See `docs/adrs/001-multi-module-with-melos.md`)
4.  **Testability:** Each component and layer should be testable in isolation. Dependency Inversion and clear interfaces are key to achieving this.
5.  **Scalability:** The architecture should be able to accommodate growth in terms of features, team size, and codebase complexity.
6.  **Maintainability:** Code should be easy to understand, modify, and debug. Consistency in patterns and clear documentation are important.

## Architectural Layers (Clean Architecture Influence)

While not strictly adhering to one named pattern (like pure Clean Architecture, Onion, Hexagonal), our approach is heavily influenced by Clean Architecture. We generally distinguish the following layers, typically within each feature module and also for shared core components:

1.  **Presentation Layer (UI & State Management):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Displaying information to the user and handling user input. Contains UI elements (Widgets), screen flows, and state management logic.
    *   **Components:**
        *   **Widgets (Flutter):** Declarative UI components.
        *   **State Management:** (e.g., BLoC/Cubit, Provider, Riverpod). Manages UI state, reacts to user interactions, and orchestrates calls to use cases/application layer.
        *   **Navigation/Routing:** Handles screen transitions.
    *   **Dependencies:** Depends on the Domain Layer (via Use Cases or View Models that use Use Cases). Should not directly access the Data Layer.

2.  **Domain Layer (Business Logic & Entities):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Contains the core business logic, rules, and entities of the application. This layer is independent of any UI, database, or network specifics.
    *   **Components:**
        *   **Entities/Models:** Plain Dart objects representing core data structures (e.g., `UserProfile`, `Product`). These are often pure and have no external dependencies.
        *   **Use Cases (Interactors):** Encapsulate specific pieces of business logic or application-specific tasks (e.g., `LoginUserUseCase`, `FetchProductDetailsUseCase`). They orchestrate data flow between the Presentation Layer and Repositories.
        *   **Abstract Repositories:** Define contracts (interfaces) for data operations that the Domain Layer requires. The actual implementation of these repositories resides in the Data Layer.
    *   **Dependencies:** Has no dependencies on other layers within the application (it's the most independent layer).

3.  **Data Layer (Data Sources & Repositories):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Handles all data operations, including fetching data from remote sources (network APIs), local sources (databases, shared preferences, secure storage), and managing data caching.
    *   **Components:**
        *   **Repository Implementations:** Concrete implementations of the abstract repositories defined in the Domain Layer. They orchestrate data from different data sources.
        *   **Data Sources (Remote & Local):**
            *   **Remote Data Sources:** Communicate with backend APIs (e.g., REST, GraphQL). Handle serialization/deserialization of data (DTOs - Data Transfer Objects).
            *   **Local Data Sources:** Manage local persistence (e.g., SQLite, SharedPreferences, Secure Storage).
        *   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Models that represent data structures for external sources (e.g., API responses). These are mapped to/from Domain Entities by repositories or mappers.
        *   **Mappers:** Responsible for converting data between DTOs (Data Layer) and Entities (Domain Layer).
    *   **Dependencies:** Depends on the Domain Layer (to implement its repository interfaces and use domain entities for mapping). Also depends on external packages for networking, databases, etc.

## Feature Modules

-   The application is divided into feature modules (e.g., `feature_auth`, `feature_home`, `feature_profile`).
-   Each feature module ideally contains its own Presentation, Domain, and Data layers related to that specific feature.
-   Shared functionalities across features are extracted into `core_` packages (e.g., `core_ui`, `core_networking`, `core_utils`) or `shared_` directories/packages.
-   This modularity is managed using Melos for local packages (see `packages/` directory).

## Diagrams

Visual representations of the architecture can be found in:

-   (More diagrams can be added for specific aspects like data flow, DI, etc.)

## State Management
(Placeholder: "This section will detail the chosen state management solution, e.g., BLoC/Cubit, including its integration within the presentation layer, communication patterns, and best practices. See `docs/state_management_guide.md` for more.")

## Dependency Injection (DI)
(Placeholder: "This section will explain how dependency injection (e.g., using GetIt) is used throughout the application to provide dependencies to different layers and components, promoting loose coupling and testability. See `lib/core/di/` for implementation.")

## Further Reading
-   `docs/folder_structure_guide.md` (TODO) for how these layers map to the directory structure.
-   Individual feature `README.md` files for feature-specific architectural notes.

This architecture aims to provide a solid foundation for building a complex and evolving Flutter application. Adherence to these principles and patterns is encouraged for all new development.
